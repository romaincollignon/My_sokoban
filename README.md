## :rocket: Introduction

    Map file representing the warehouse map, containing â€˜#â€™ for walls, â€˜Pâ€™ for the
    player, â€˜Xâ€™ for boxes and â€˜Oâ€™ for storage locations.

    The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically
    onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move
    into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed
    into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The number of boxes is
    equal to the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all boxes
    are at storage locations.
